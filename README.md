# Social-Auth-Claim
A [DecentSDK](https://docs.decent.xyz), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Privy](https://privy.io/) starter repo designed to let creators and projects grow their social followings by using NFTs as a carrot for engagement.

This repository was cloned from Decent's [Minting Page](https://github.com/decentxyz/Minting-Page) starter repo and is currently in beta.  We are publishing it as an MVP with the hope that the community will close out our roadmap.  We will be sure to recognize & reward contributors!  If you are interested in using or contributing to this template, please DM me on Twitter [@cdurbinxyz](https://twitter.com/cdurbinxyz).  I will selectively add developers to the private repository to advance this Decent template and deploy custom implementations.  Look forward to hearing from you!

## About Decent Templates
The social auth template is the fourth in a series that enables creators and developers to get up and running with custom minting and deployment sites faster than anywhere else.  This template is currently in private beta, but please see the list of open source templates below in the meantime to start deploying your own custom dapps today!

#### [Minting Page](https://github.com/decentxyz/Minting-Page)
Forked from Start Decent, this template lets users stand up a custom minting page to provide collectors with an experience that is uniquely yours.  To see just how easy it is (& the breadth of Decent HQ!), please check out my [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s72S5_5HWAk).
